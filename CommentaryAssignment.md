Option A


As you did in translation 2, please select two choices of syntax, word order, or diction that Hyginus makes from anywhere in your Latin reading, and comment briefly on how Hyginus’ choice complements or enhances the meaning of the passage’s content.

Discuss briefly: no more than 2-4 sentences for each example. Italicize Latin words when citing them.

You may select examples from anything you have looked at in Hyginus, from the narrative of his 12 deeds in chapter 30, or the story of his death in chapter 36.


Hyginus 30.2 used "necavit" rather than "interfectit." I found this interestibg diction choice because although they both essentially mean "killed." The use of "necavit" demonstrates a much more brutal and violent means of killing.

Hyginus 30.7-9 did not use any subjunctive clauses, which was something I found interesting due to their common apperance in Hyginus's writings. This implies that the circumstances undre which the actions were ocurring were mot significant, but rather the timing and order of events mattered most.
