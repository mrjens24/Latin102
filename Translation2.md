A. Grammatical analysis

Place each verbal idea (clause, indirect statement, participial expression) on a separate line, indented to show its level of subordination. Italicize the verb of each unit by surrounding it with asterisks.




B. Grammatical questions

Identify the antecedent of cui, and its gender and number. Then explain what case cui is, and how it functions in the relative clause. (I.e., why is cui in this case?)

> flumen (river), neuter singular. cui is dative because the river is dative of the possesor.❌

Identify the form of transire. Explain why you placed it in the clause you chose.

> transire is present❌ active infinitive. The verb poterat is a complementary to the infinitive.

sublatam is from a verb that is a compound of sub plus a verb you should know very well. Identify the form of this participle (which for participles means: gender, case, number, tense voice). Find the dictionary entry for this word in thed Lewis-Short’s Latin Dictionary, and give its URN here.

> Sublatam is feminine accusative singular, perfect passive. urn:cite2:hmt:ls.markdown:n45940

Identify the form of sagittis. Why does Hyginus use this case?

> Ablative because it is the instrument of means

Identify the form of moriens.

> present active participle masculine nominative singular

Identify felle. Why does Hyginus use this case?

> neuter ablative singular. It is ablative because it is explaining the means which the arrows were soaked

Identify the form of tinctas.

> perfect passive feminine accusitive plural

Identify the form of exceptum.

> perfect passive masculine accusative singular

William Faulkner’s novel As I lay dying takes its title from an English translation of a single word in Odyssey 11.424. In Greek, where participles function very differently from English but similarly to Latin, that word is a present active participle. Suggest one or more possible translations of Faulkner’s title into Latin.

> moriens




C. Translation


Deinanira, the wife of Hercules, was not able to cross the great river, which was named Evenus, and she asked the centaur Nessus, who was the son of Ixion and Nubis, for help. He wanted to rape Dinanira, when she was being carried across the river itself. Here Hercules, when he had interrupted and when Deinanira begged his protection, pierced Nessus with arrows. As he is dying, when he knew that the arrows held a great strength because they were soaked in the poison of Hydra Lernaea, he gave his own blood to Deinanira and said that it was a love potion.
