-indirect statement
-use of ablative and accusative to express time

Vocabulary and notes
-devirgino, devirginare, devirginavi, devirginatus:
-absum (ab + sum): “to be away, be absent” (principal parts have the same forms as sum)
-nuptiae, nuptiarum (f.): “marriage, wedding”
-certus, a, um: “settled, determined, fixed”
-intervenio (inter + venio): “to come between, interrupt” (principal parts have the same forms as venio)

Note:
daturum (with esse understood) is the future active infinitive of do. Why does Hyginus use the infinitive here?

Passage to analyze

Hercules cum in hospitium ad Dexamenum regem uenisset eiusque filiam Deianiram deuirginasset, volebat eam uxorem ducere. cum Hercules abesset, centaurus Eurytion petit Deianiram uxorem. quia pater eius centaurum timebat, pollicitus est se daturum.
