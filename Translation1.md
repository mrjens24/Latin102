Translation 1: wives of Hercules

Concepts to review
-temporal clauses with indicative and subjunctive
-indirect statement
-use of ablative and accusative to express time

Vocabulary and notes
-devirgino, devirginare, devirginavi, devirginatus:
-absum (ab + sum): “to be away, be absent” (principal parts have the same forms as sum)
-nuptiae, nuptiarum (f.): “marriage, wedding”
-certus, a, um: “settled, determined, fixed”
-intervenio (inter + venio): “to come between, interrupt” (principal parts have the same forms as venio)

Note:
daturum (with esse understood) is the future active infinitive of do. Why does Hyginus use the infinitive here?

Passage to analyze
(Based on Hyginus, chapter 33.)

Hercules cum in hospitium ad Dexamenum regem uenisset eiusque filiam Deianiram deuirginasset, volebat eam uxorem ducere. cum Hercules abesset, centaurus Eurytion petit Deianiram uxorem. quia pater eius centaurum timebat, pollicitus est se daturum.

Tempore certo, venit centaurus cum fratribus ad nuptias. Hercules interuenit et centaurum interfecit, Deianiram abduxit.

When Hercules was absent, the centaur Eurytion demanded Deianira as a wife. Since her father feared the centaur, he promised that he would give his daughter in marriage. On the designated day, the centaur came with his brothers to the wedding. Hercules came between them and killed the centaur, he led Deianira away.
