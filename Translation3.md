Translation 3: Three labors of Hercules


Glossary and notes

Note: the verb sum, esse, fui, futurus has no present participle! If you want to construct the equivalent of a normal verbal unit using a participle with a noun, you can simply omit the verb “to be” and include the predicate (just as you can with finite forms of sum: Herculis fortis could be a complete sentence). This is most easily recognizable when the noun is an ablative in ablative absolute construction.


Vocabulary:

Augeas, Augeae (m), Augeas, king of Elis


bobile, bobilis (n), “stall”

caro, carnis (f), “flesh, meat”

Iuppiter, Iovis (m), Jupiter

purgo, purgare, purgavi, purgatus, “to clean (something, from something else)” Note that purgo can take two accusative direct objects.

quattuor (indeclinable adj.), “four”

stercus, stercoris (n), “dung, manure”

C. Literary commentary

Choose two choices of syntax, word order, or diction that Hyginus makes in this passage that complement or enhance the meaning of the passage’s content. Discuss briefly s in 3-4 sentences. Italicize Latin words when citing them.
> One choice of syntax I found complemented the menaing of the passage was the use of ablative agent in the phrase, *Iove adiutore*. This gave further context as to the help provided. Another interesting diction choice was the use of the word *admisso,* as it changes the setting of the sentence and gives context.
